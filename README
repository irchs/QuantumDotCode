This is the initial prototype/ideas code for a simulation of quantum dots
using the Finite Element Method. 

I will be testing my ideas in Matlab and then hopefully (if time allows) 
moving to some faster implementation. 

Currently the files are organised in two directories, one for each style
of matrix representation. There are some file redundancies between the two
directories. This is done so that each directory can be used on its own.
