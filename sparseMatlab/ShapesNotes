Shapes:

	For storng the different primitvies that make up our shape
	we will be using a 2D 'cell' array. The first dimension
	is for each different primitive (sphere, cylinder, cube ...)
	the second dimension is for each instance of that primitive.

	The issue is that each primitive may vary in number. In order
	to avoid complicating this we will first count the number of 
	each primitive and then run for loops that correspond to each
	primitive. We can count the number of each primitive as they 
	are created and pass those numbers to the 'calcV' function.

	Ideally we would then crate a file that could be read in order
	to create the shapes cell-array.
